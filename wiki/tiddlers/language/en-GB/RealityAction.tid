! Reality Action Tag Usage Guide

[[Reality Action Button Examples|RealityActionExamples]].

!! What is Reality Action?

Reality Action is a core concept in the gamification framework that converts meaningful behaviors in the real world into reward events in the game. By adding the <$transclude $variable=tag tag={{$:/plugins/linonetwo/tw-gamification/tags/reality-action-meta-tag}} /> tag to tiddlers, you can create check-in buttons. Clicking the button is equivalent to completing a beneficial action in the real world.

This tag can be adjusted in the settings, but it is generally set to `$:/Tags/Gamification/RealityAction` by default.

!! Two Ways to Trigger Reality Actions

!!! Method 1: Using Predefined Action Tiddlers (Recommended)

This is the traditional approach, suitable for repetitive daily habits:

```
<$button>
  <$action-sendmessage
    $message="tm-reality-action-event"
    $param="action-tiddler-title"
  />
  Button Text
</$button>
```

The "action-tiddler-title" is the title of a tiddler you created that must have the <$transclude $variable=tag tag={{$:/plugins/linonetwo/tw-gamification/tags/reality-action-meta-tag}} /> tag and contain all necessary fields.

!!! Method 2: Direct Parameter Passing (Suitable for One-time Activities)

This approach does not require creating dedicated tiddlers and is suitable for temporary activities or one-time events. ''All required fields must be provided:''

```
<$button>
  <$action-sendmessage
    $message="tm-reality-action-event"
    reality-event-type="SmallReward"
    reality-event-amount="3"
    caption="Join Special Event"
    reality-event-message="Completed special task!"
    title="unique-action-id"
  />
  Join Special Event
</$button>
```

!!! Parameter Override

If both `$param` and other parameters are provided, the other parameters will override the corresponding fields in the tiddler:

```
<$button>
  <$action-sendmessage
    $message="tm-reality-action-event"
    $param="base-action-tiddler"
    reality-event-amount="10"
  />
  Double Reward Special Version
</$button>
```

!! How to Create Reality Actions?

!!! Basic Steps

# Create a new tiddler
# Add the <$transclude $variable=tag tag={{$:/plugins/linonetwo/tw-gamification/tags/reality-action-meta-tag}} /> tag
# Fill in the necessary fields to define the action's properties

!!! Required Fields

|!Field Name |!Description |!Example Values |
|`reality-event-type` |Event type, determines reward size |`SmallReward`, `LargeReward`, `SmallPunishment`, `LargePunishment` |
|`reality-event-amount` |Reward amount |`1`, `0.2`, `5` and other numbers |
|`title` |Unique identifier for the action tiddler |`My Daily Check-in`, `exercise-one-time-action` |

''Note:'' For Method 2 (direct parameter passing), all these fields must be provided in the message widget. For Method 1 (predefined tiddlers), these fields must be defined in the tiddler and can also be overridden in the message widget.

!!! Optional Fields

|!Field Name |!Description |!Example Values |
|`reality-event-message` |Message displayed when completing the action |`Congratulations on going to bed early!` |
|`description` |Detailed description of the action, encouraging players to complete tasks |`Going to bed before 10 PM is good for your health because... (30 characters omitted)` |
|`icon` |Icon displayed on the button |Image tiddler title, such as `$:/core/images/sleep`, preferably SVG images |
|`enabled` |Whether to enable this action, allowing players to turn off tasks they don't want to see |`yes` or `no` |
|`caption` |Text displayed on the button, fallback to `title` |`Early Sleep Check-in`, `Morning Exercise Complete` |

!!!! About the reality-event-message field:

This field defines the message content that should be displayed to users when completing an action, but it ''will not be automatically displayed''. The specific usage depends on the game implementation:

* Game Integration：Some game sub-plugins may read this field and automatically display notifications
* Manual Invocation：If you want to display notifications directly in buttons, you need to add an additional notification action widget:

```
<$button>
  <$action-sendmessage
    $message="tm-reality-action-event"
    $param="action-tiddler-title"
  />
  Button Text
</$button>

<$action-sendmessage
  $message="tm-notify"
  $param="$:/plugins/linonetwo/tw-gamification/tiddlywiki-ui/notification/on-reality-action-event"
  message="Congratulations on completing the action!"
/>
```

!!! Anti-duplicate Fields

To prevent getting rewards from repeated clicks in a short time, you can set the following fields:

|!Field Name |!Description |!Example Values |
|`find-duplicate` |Anti-duplicate method |`debounce` (debouncing) |
|`debounce-duration` |Cooldown time (seconds) |`43200` (12 hours), `86400` (24 hours) |

!!! Recording Fields

|!Field Name |!Description |!Example Values |
|`activity-log-type` |Recording type |`day-interval` (daily recording) |
|`activity-log` |Recording storage location |Tiddler title for storing check-in records |

!! Usage Tips

!!! Reward Type Selection

* `SmallReward`: Suitable for daily small habits, such as drinking water, taking notes
* `LargeReward`: Suitable for important goals, such as exercise, study, early sleep
* `SmallPunishment`: Mild negative reminders
* `LargePunishment`: Important warnings

!!! Cooldown Time Settings

* 1 hour = 3600 seconds
* 6 hours = 21600 seconds  
* 12 hours = 43200 seconds
* 24 hours = 86400 seconds

!!! Best Practices

# Start with simple habits and gradually increase difficulty
# Set reasonable cooldown times to avoid point farming
# Regularly check check-in records to understand your progress
# Adjust reward amounts according to actual circumstances

!! How to Use?

After creating reality action tiddlers, game plugins will automatically generate corresponding check-in buttons. You can:

# Find the check-in buttons you created in the game interface
# After completing the corresponding actions in the real world, click the button to check in
# The system will automatically record your check-in time and earned rewards
# These rewards can be used in supported games

Remember: Honest check-ins truly help you develop good habits, gamification is just an incentive tool!
